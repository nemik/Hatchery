The Hatchery is an interactive art installation at 210 N. Wells Chicago, IL. 

It is powered by an Arduino monitoring two photoresistors though its ADC ports. One photoresistor is to measure ambient light and the other to measure when a hand is placed over it; when they differ beyond a threshold, it counts as a 'touch' and an LED light sequence is initiated. Also, every time someone interacts with the scultpure, the date and time of the interaction is logged and later displayed at http://nemik.net/hatchery

The logging happens because the Arduino sends a 9600 baud serial message to a small Linux router (TP-Link WR703n) running OpenWRT linux with a USB flash drive and SQLite3 database. Each timestamp for a touch is added to a table in the SQLite DB.
The router broadcasts a publically available wi-fi access point and uses uhttpd to serve up a default page and also the SQLite DB when asked. Because the installation space does not have internet access, I walk by the space from time to time to download the new data.
